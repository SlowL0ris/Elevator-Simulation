# Elevator Simulation

A simulation I created after I watched [team 971's presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGtT8ojgSzg) about test driven development.

### Live plotting
In order to use live plotting I recommend to use [gnuplot](http://gnuplot.info/). I also attached [a script](/script.plt) in order to make everyone's lives easier.
